Dal w/ Mung Beans, Carrots, and Cashews

1.5 cups of dried mung beans
.5 cups whole cashews
3-4 medium-sized carrots
2 tbsp. peeled and minced fresh ginger
2 tbsp. minced garlic
A pinch of turmeric
2 cups of coconut milk
.25 cups brown sugar, or to taste
Salt and pepper, to taste
.5 cups Thai basil (or regular basil)
.5 cups sliced scallions/green onions
Juice from 1 lime
2 dried Thai chiles

1. Combine the beans, cashews, carrots, ginger, garlic, turmeric, coconut milk, and brown sugar in a large pot.  Add enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to medium-low so the mixture bubbles steadily and lightly.  Cook for 45-60 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding some salt as the beans become tender, adding water or coconut milk as needed to keep everything moist.
2. Whe the beans are tender and the liquid is thickened, sprinkle with pepper and stir in the basil, scallions, and lime juice.  Cook for a minute or two more, then taste, adjust the seasoning, and serve.  Also good as leftovers once the seasoning has seeped in.
